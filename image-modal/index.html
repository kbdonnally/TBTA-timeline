  <p>"Being asked what was the nature of the charge against him, he said, he had been accused of visiting a house of ill fame - He said he had been before the Faculty of that Institution several times. He did not speak disrespectfully to Mr. Mitchell (a professor) until he conceived himself insulted - After he was dismissed by the Faculty of the University of North Carolina he says the Trustees expelled him at their next meeting."</p>
