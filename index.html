      <h3>Board of Visitors' Meeting Minutes, July 10th, 1828</h3>
      <p>The Faculty and Board of Visitors has "the power of punishing offences, and reserve to the Visitors the power only of approving or disapproving sentences of expulsion: And, though they justly appreciate the motives of delicacy which induced the Faculty to refer this subject to them, they must decline pronouncing any judgment on the conduct of the Student. But they would on every occasion, solemnly enjoin on the Students, as essential to their own welfare, and the character of the institution, the utmost deference and respect for the professors; in the confidence that the professors will entitle themselves to that deference & respect, by the dignity of their deportment, & especially by avoiding all personal collision with the Students and all personal violence towards them."</p>
