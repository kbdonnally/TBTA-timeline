       <p>“Mr. Forbes told him if his servants, did not do their duty better, he would report him and whip his damned servants. They then went on, and Mr. Rose saw them go into Keller's Confectionary. Messrs. Jno. M. Forbes & Wm. P. Braxton were sent for. Mr. Forbes admits that he kicked Mr. Rose's servant. Being asked if he hurt him, he said, he did not know, but he tried to do so, for he kicked him as hard as he could. They both say they went to Keller's to get their breakfast, but refuse to say whether they have been there before, during the present session. They complain of great negligence on the part of Mr. Rose's dormitory-servants, and assert that their rooms are never cleaned by 8 o'c. A. M. Mr. Davis proposed the following resolution. "Mr. Wm. P. Braxton and Mr. Jno. M. Forbes having in vioation of the laws of the University gone to Keller's yesterday morning, and there, taken their breakfast, because the Hotel - Keeper would not send their breakfasts to their rooms, therefore resolved that they be suspended for a fortnight." "Dr. Magill amended this resolution by proposing that the Chairman reprimand Messrs. Forbes & Braxton and write to their parents that they would have been suspended if it were not for the circumstance that they would, during their suspension, miss the intermediate examinations in several of the classes which they attend.</p>

       <p>While the Visitors are in full sympathy with the movement looking to the higher education of woman and they deprecate the want of proper facilities to furnish them such advantages, still considering the plan and constitution and believing coeducation therein was never contemplated by the founder of the institution, they, the Visitors feel impelled to deny them admission to the University as students. Therefore 1. Resolved that women shall not be permitted to enter the University as students. 2. Resolved that any and all provisions for the registration of women at the University in any way and for any purpose, and which as reported by the Faculty, are unsatisfactory and useless, be and the same are hereby rescinded....Resolved that it is deemed inadvisable that women should enter the University of Virginia as students until an adequate preparation has been made for that purpose. But in the event that an Annex is built not nearer than two miles of the University of Virginia this Board deems it advisable and proper that women should receive all of the instruction in an equal manner with men, the said Annex to be under the control of a prudent and discreet matron, and the lectures at the said Annex to be delivered by the University professors to women alone. The want of funds for the present prevents the building of this most desirable Annex which would place women so far as the University of Virginia is concerned upon terms of equality with men.</p>

       <h3>Board of Visitors' Meeting Minutes, January none, 1912</h3>
       <p>The Board having been called to order, the Bill now pending before the General Assembly, entitled, "A Bill to Establish a Co-ordinate State College for Women," was submitted for discussion, whereupon after discussion, Mr. White offered the following; viz.-Resolved: That the bill entitled, "A Bill to Establish a Co-ordinate State College for Women," now pending before the General Assembly of Virginia, and which has been brought before this Board somewhat suddenly, is a matter of such gravity as to call for the most serious consideration of the Board, and, in order that such consideration may be given to the matter, it is the sense of the Board that the General Assembly be requested to postpone a consideration of the Bill, until this Board can have an opportunity to form a correct judgment of the measure, as it affects the best interests of the University and of the people of the State.—And Mr. Harmon offered the following:—Resolved: That it is the sense of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia that a co-ordinate college for women should be established at or near the University of Virginia, under the control of the Rector and Visitors of the University, but without co-education of the  sexes  in any of the courses, except the courses leading to the "Degree of Doctor of Philosophy." Further, it is the opinion of the Board that the bill now before the General Assembly does not conform to these principles.</p>

       <p>I. The Student Council will hold the Interfraternity Council strictly accountable for the observance by the social fraternities of the University's rules governing conduct in fraternity houses. In addition, the Council will hold other organizations responsible for conduct at such social functions as these organizations may sponsor. II. The Student Council during the coming year will undertake an intensive program of publicity, with a view toward building up student support and sentiment in favor of the improvements of standards of deportment. ---Permitting women visitors in rooms on the Lawn and Ranges and in dormitory buildings during certain hours---The abolition of the rule requiring chaperones in fraternity houses --Conclusion: The Council feels that it should state that it cannot accept responsibility for the apprehension of students guilty of isolated instances of student  misconduct off the Grounds of the University. However, the Council wishes to make it clear that it will discipline any students brought before this body for such incidents. Furthermore, the Council will endeavor to prevent such cases by attempting to build up student sentiment against such misconduct .

       <p>STUDENT DISCIPLINE- At the request of the Rector, President Darden reported on the action taken regarding an occurrence of student  misconduct  that took place on the weekend of April 3rd-4th. He outlined the inquiry conducted by himself and by Mr. Richard R.

       <h3>Student response, July none, 1984</h3>
       <p>In responseto a recent increase in reported rapes in the Charlottesville area, a group of Charlottesville residents collaborates with the University to form a rape task force. The group hopes to reduce rape by 25% in the first year, spread awareness of rape, and increase reporting. The article discusses a recent change in sexual assault litigation, whereby a woman is no longer required to demonstrate that she "reasonably resisted assault" in order to press charges.</p>

Although it was clear that racial insults were part of the  assault , it was not known for several days that the persons assaulted are students at the University.

       <h3>Board of Visitors' Meeting Minutes, March none, 1998</h3>
       <p>By virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor, I hereby declare that it is the firm and unwavering policy of the Commonwealth of Virginia to assure equal opportunity in all facets of State government. This policy specifically prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex, color, national origin, religion, age, or political affiliation, or against otherwise qualified persons with disabilities. State appointing authorities and other management principals are hereby directed to take affirmative measures, as determined by the Director, Department of Personnel and Training, to emphasize the recruitment of qualified minorities, women, disabled persons, and older Virginians to serve at all levels of State government. This directive does not permit or require the lowering of bona fide job requirements, performance standards, or qualifications to give preference to any state employee or applicant for state employment.</p>

       <p>Comments by Meg Gould- student board member -“As the University is certainly aware of and working exhaustively to address this issue, in the words of the external chair for the Sexual Assault Leadership Council, students and the institution can ?do better? – we can do better, we can do more, and we can do it earlier for students. Student Council crafted a statement called the SMART (Sexual Misconduct Awareness, Recovery, and Tangible change) Resolution, in partnership with many student awareness organizations, that made seven practical recommendations including increasing bystander intervention training, and lending transparency to the selection for the Sexual Misconduct Board. There also will be a concerted effort to address sexual misconduct with first years at the start of the year to produce an initial and lasting culture of mutual respect, safety and support. I hope that the University continues both to lead a national conversation regarding sexual misconduct as we have this year, and to seek on-the-ground ways to address the issue.”</p>
